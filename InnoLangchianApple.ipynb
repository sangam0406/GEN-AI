            "To cure late blight disease in potatoes, a proactive approach is required. This includes selecting potato varieties known for their resistance or tolerance to late blight, avoiding planting potatoes in the same field consecutively and rotating with non-host crops to break the disease cycle. When conditions are conducive to late blight development, the use of fungicides is recommended. Consultation with local agricultural experts for recommendations and proper application timing is also advised. Organic practices like crop rotation, resistant varieties, and sanitation can also be employed to reduce the risk of late blight. Vigilance and timely action are crucial in the battle against late blight.\n",
